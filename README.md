# cat-modeling-agency

<p>Homepage for a fictional talent agency. Practicing page layout with Flexbox and some Bootstrap 5 elements, plus hover effects, favicon, and a sticky, transparent navbar.</p> 

<p>I learned a lot from this one, but it's not responsive (yet!)</p>

<h6>Second page I ever made.</h6>
